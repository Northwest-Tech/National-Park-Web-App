                    <h3>The Badlands</h3>
                    <p>The Badlands are a striking landscape of rugged beauty, shaped over millions of years by wind and water. Towering rock formations, layered with colorful bands of sediment, rise above deep canyons and sprawling prairies. Known for their dramatic scenery and rich fossil beds, the Badlands offer a glimpse into ancient history and a haven for wildlife today. Visitors are drawn to the mix of stark, otherworldly terrain and wide-open skies that make the region truly unforgettable.</p>
