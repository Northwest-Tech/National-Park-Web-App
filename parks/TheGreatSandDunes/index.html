            <p>The Great Sand Dunes National Park in southern Colorado is home to the tallest dunes in North America, some rising over 750 feet. Set against the backdrop of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, this unique landscape blends desert, grasslands, and alpine forests. Visitors can hike, sled, or simply marvel at the ever-shifting sands shaped by wind and water. It’s a one-of-a-kind destination offering adventure, beauty, and a glimpse of nature’s incredible power.</p>
